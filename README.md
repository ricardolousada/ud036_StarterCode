# Ricardo Lousada's Favourite Movies

This project is the first assigment for The Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
The code consists in the following file:

- |**movies.py**:            Defines a class **Movie** wich is used to store movies data
- **entertainment_center**:  This is the main file of the project
- **fresh_tomatoes.py**:     This is supplied file to create a dinamyc web page with the movies information

I add some aditional features to the original scope of work:

1. The web page layout is more rich with the movie story line and a voting ranking
2. I have used an API to fetch all the movies information
3. One can change the predifined movies by adding or changing the names in the movies_to_search array

`movies_to_search = ["Godfather","Pulp Fiction","Reservoir Dogs","First Blood","Magnolia","Django Unchained"]`

## Usage

To run the code you need to have Pyton 2.7 installed and run the following command:

`python entertainment_center.py`
